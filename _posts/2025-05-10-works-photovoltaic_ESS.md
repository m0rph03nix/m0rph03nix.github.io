### ESS installation

{% include post_picwrap.html pos="left" src="/images/ESS/elec.jpg" %} 
Here is the architecture I designed and installed. It was verified and validated by Sunteq:
- VICTRON SmartSolar MPPT RS 450/100-MC4 (using 2 MPPT lines of 3kWp each)
- VICTRON MultiPlus-II GX 48/5000/70-50 230V (I'm not using the GX part in the end)
- VICTRON - Cerbo GX MK2 
- VICTRON - Lynx Distributor
- Pylontech Lithium 4.8kWh - US5000 48V 100A
