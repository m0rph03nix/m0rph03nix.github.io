## Half-Autonomous ESS Photovoltaic system



### Solar panels

6kWp photovoltaic installation done by Sunteq company, which I highly recommend!

### ESS installation

Here is the architecture I designed and installed. It was verified and validated by Sunteq:
- VICTRON SmartSolar MPPT RS 450/100-MC4 (using 2 MPPT lines of 3kWp each)
- VICTRON MultiPlus-II GX 48/5000/70-50 230V (I'm not using the GX part in the end)
- VICTRON - Cerbo GX MK2 
- VICTRON - Lynx Distributor
- Pylontech Lithium 4.8kWh - US5000 48V 100A

### Home Assistant integration

All the home's energy is managed on my local Home Assistant server where my own EMS (Energy Management System) runs
