## Greeting

{% capture greeting_content %}
The first three social links that you provide in the `_config.yml` file
are listed large in Spectral's first greeting section, letting folks know
how you most prefer to be contacted.
{% endcapture %}

{% include pic_with_content.html pos="left" src="/images/feature1.png" content=greeting_content %}

<hr />

## Pages

{% capture pages_content %}
The site comes with some default pages with permalinks: topics, works,
and contacts. If you create your own permalinked pages, they also show
up in the menu.
{% endcapture %}

{% include pic_with_content.html pos="right" src="/images/feature2a.png" content=pages_content %}

{% capture landing_content %}
Unless you specify `nolanding` in the page header, a link to each of your pages
shows up in the center of the landing page along with the topics and works
pages. Note that the topics and works pages are special, each listing all
the posts that belong to their own respective category.
{% endcapture %}

{% include pic_with_content.html pos="left" src="/images/feature2.png" content=landing_content %}

<p class="hws">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="hws">&nbsp;</p>

<hr />

## Works

{% capture works_content %}
Each item in your portfolio in the works category is listed in table format
on the works page. Each entry includes a work's title, excerpt, date of
completion, and demonstrated skills---items which are also on each work's
post.
{% endcapture %}

{% include pic_with_content.html pos="right" src="/images/feature4.png" content=works_content %}

<p class="hws">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="hws">&nbsp;</p>

<hr />

## Topics

{% capture topics_content %}
Each post marked as `featured` is displayed on the front page
in addition to top of the topics listing.
{% endcapture %}

{% include pic_with_content.html pos="left" src="/images/feature3.png" content=topics_content %}

{% capture topics_year_content %}
On the topics page, underneath the featured topics, the topics are listed
by year.

At the top of the site's content pages and posts is a navigation breadcrumb.
{% endcapture %}

{% include pic_with_content.html pos="right" src="/images/feature5.png" content=topics_year_content %}

<!-- <p><img src="{{ '/images/feature6.png' | prepend: site.baseurl}}" alt=""/></p> -->

{% include post_picwrap.html pos="fit" max="265" src="/images/feature6.png" %}

{% capture topics_group_content %}
You can group related topics together into the same category. These grouped
topics are ordered by date as usual but are also provided with Back
and Next links.
{% endcapture %}

{% include pic_with_content.html pos="left" src="/images/feature6a.png" content=topics_group_content %}

## Spectral

{% include post_picwrap.html pos="right" src="/images/feature7a.png" %}
{% include post_picwrap.html pos="left" src="/images/feature7b.png" %}
Also included are of course the features that are provided with the awesome
[HTML5 UP](https://HTML5up.net) Spectral theme itself---features
such as text wrapping around pictures and the skel column layout formatting.
For more about the page customization possible with the Spectral layout, see
the [Elements]({{ '/topics/elements.html' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) page.
