#### Full design of vaccuum cleaning robot (at 17 years old)

In 2004, a vacuum cleaning robot was rather a dream than a product on shelf !

So I thought... why not doing one ?
Also I had the opportunity to prepare an optionnal project for the Bacalaureate, and for the first time in 2004 it could be in robotics !
