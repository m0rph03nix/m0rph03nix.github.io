#### Story of my first robot started at 12 years old!
This is my first "big" robotics project. At that time, there was no Arduino and no YouTube tutorials... we were in 1998. I was 12 when I started, 13 when I finished.
I did a 3 DoF robot arm + gripper... but unfortunately, I cannot find any picture (argentic at this time) with my realization and we are now 20 years later :(
Just imagine:

- Robot links were done with old wood frames of my family home.
- Motors (unipolar step motor) and gear trains came from old photocopier given by my uncle Bernard (thanks)
- The electronics and PCB design was my own design. It contained mainly byte-latches and UL2803 circuits.
- The electronic board was done in my garage on a one layer copper board soaked in iron perchloride. The board was connected on the parallel port of my computer.
- The robot was controlled by my computer (DX286 - 33MHz - 1MB RAM - MS-DOS OS) with a C++ program done with Borland Turbo C++. At that time my code was pretty ugly, but I made it work!
