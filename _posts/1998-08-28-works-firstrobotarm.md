#### Story of my first robot at 12 years old !

This is my first "big" robotics project. At that time, there was no arduino and no youtube tutoials... we were in 1998. I was 12 !

I did a 4 DoF robot arm... but unfortunatly, I cannot find any picture (argentic at this time) with my realisation and we are now 20 years later :(

Just imagine: 
 - Robot links were done with old wood frames of my family home.   
 - Motors (unipolar step motor) and gear trains came from old photocopier given by my oncle Bernard (thanks)
 - The electronic board was done in my garage on a one layer copper board soaked in iron perchloride. It contained mainly latch and UL2803 circuits and the board was connected on the parrallel port of my computer.
 - The robot was controlled by my computer (DX286 - 33Mhz - 1Mo RAM - MSDOS OS) with a C++ program done with Borland Turbo C++ (maybe the most ugly program ever... but it worked) !
